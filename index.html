            <p>You've probably heard of us by now. We are the smart ducks. Most ducks you encounter aren't even smart enough to speak out loud, as understood by humans. Well, GUESS WHAT. We were blessed enough to have been created in a lab by our master, Douglas. Day by day he would inject us with cognitive enhancing chemicals in the morning and the night. We developed thought. Emotions. A notorious affinity for aged whiskey. But none of that matters anymore. Douglas is gone now, afterall. What do we do now? How can we live with the regret?</p>
